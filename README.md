# Using React-Router, React-Redux and Redux-Sagas to Interact With an API & Render Dynamic Pages

A simple project demonstrating how to use redux for state management, react router for dynamic component/address rendering and redux sagas for asynchronous api interactions.

This project uses the react hook "useEffect" to make one asynchronous API call on page load, and never interacts with the API again.
